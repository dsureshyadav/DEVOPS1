AND SELECT ON GITHUB HOOK TRIGGER FOR GITSCM POLLING (IT WILL RECIVE FROM THE GITHUB REPOSITORY WHEN TRIGGER IS HAPPEND
    CONFIGURE BUILD IT.

 STEP 2: GOTO OUR OWN GITHUB REPOSITORY ->
SETTING ->WEBHOOKS->
HERE GIVE JENKINS URL UPTO PORTNO THEN GIVE NAME AS GITHUB-WEBHOOK.(EX:http://52.90.33.208:8080/github-webhook/) & save it

WHATEVER YOUR GIVEN in webhooks (ex:http://52.90.33.208:8080/github-webhook/)same as given here. save it
